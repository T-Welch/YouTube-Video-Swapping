Despite their published claims to the contrary, youtube has a "Top Secret" video replacement feature. According to top creator Veritassium. In a talk titled "Becoming Veritasium" given by Dr. Derek Muller at William Osmann's Open Sauce conference Muller admits "There's a secret way, that I probably shouldn't mention, that you can swap out videos on Youtube. But that's very top secret"

Large creators in the past have spoken about how they've removed videos due to inaccuracies or due to issues with baked in sponsor segments indicating that while this is a feature, it is not a feature that is well known in the creator community. 

While a feature such as this seems obvious from a technical standpoint it raises concerns with regard to misinformation, manipulation, and trust on the platform.

Youtube officially claims "You can’t replace a video since any new video uploads will get a new URL". Somewhere between 09-24-2024 and 10-4-2024 Youtube changed the wording of this answer from "You can delete any video you uploaded to your YouTube channel. You can’t replace a video since any new video uploads will get a new URL, but you can change the existing video." to "You can delete any video uploaded to your YouTube channel. "ou can’t replace a video since any new video upload will get a new URL, but you can modify the existing video."
