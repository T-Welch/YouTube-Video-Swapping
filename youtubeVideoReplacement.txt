Title: Veritasium leaks YouTube's "Top Secret" video swapping feature at Open Sauce

Despite their published claims to the contrary, youtube has a "Top Secret" video replacement feature, according to top creator Veritasium. In a talk titled "Becoming Veritasium" given by Dr. Derek Muller (Veritasium) at William Osmann's Open Sauce conference Muller states "There's a secret way, that I probably shouldn't mention, that you can swap out videos on Youtube. But that's very top secret"

Large creators in the past have spoken about how they've removed videos due to inaccuracies or due to issues with baked-in sponsor segments indicating that while this is a feature, it is not a feature that is well known in the creator community.

While a feature such as this seems obvious from a technical standpoint it raises concerns with regard to misinformation, manipulation, and trust on the platform.

Youtube officially claims "You can’t replace a video since any new video uploads will get a new URL". Somewhere between 09-24-2024 and 10-4-2024 Youtube changed the wording of this answer from "You can delete any video you uploaded to your YouTube channel. You can’t replace a video since any new video uploads will get a new URL, but you can change the existing video." to "You can delete any video uploaded to your YouTube channel. "you can't replace a video since any new video upload will get a new URL, but you can modify the existing video."

My Opinion as required by the forum rules:

The thought of watching a video, and then someone else watching the "same" video but seeing a different video all together is concerning because it breaks my illusion of "truth" or "objectivity". I guess I always just thought of it like a TV show where as long as it was the same episode name or number (I guess video id in youtube case) then it was the same exact video save for minor edits that are available in the youtube creator studio
